## What's in this `Fabrication` directory?
In `Fabrication`, you'll find design details for both versions of the DIY sensor (i.e. PVC and Polycase enclosures).
Inside the `PVC-Enclosure` and `Polycase-Enclosure` folders:
- `BOM,` or Bill of Materials, lists parts, costs, and where to purchase them.
- `Enclosure-and-Assembly` houses information about assembling the hardware for your sensor.
- `Datasheets` are documents from manufacturers that detail individual parts.

## What design should I use?
If you're deciding whether to proceed with a PVC or Polycase housing for your DIY sensor, we suggest exploring the folders in this directory to determine which design best fits your needs.
