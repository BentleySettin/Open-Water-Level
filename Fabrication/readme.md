In this Fabrication directory, you'll find design details for both versions of the DIY sensor (i.e. PVC and Polycase enclosures).

- `BOM,` or Bill of Materials, lists components, their costs, and where to purchase them.
- `Enclosure-and-Assembly` houses information about using physical parts and assembling sensors.
- `Datasheets` has documents with comprehensive info about specific parts.

If you're deciding whether to proceed with a PVC or Polycase housing for your DIY sensor, we suggest exploring the folders in this directory to determine which design best fits your needs.
