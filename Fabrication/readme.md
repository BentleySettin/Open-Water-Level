## What's in this `Fabrication` directory?
In `Fabrication`, you'll find design details for both versions of the DIY sensor (i.e. PVC and Polycase enclosures).
- `Setting_Up.md` has visual and written instructions for setting up your sensor.

Inside the `PVC-Enclosure` and `Polycase-Enclosure` folders:
- `BOM,` or Bill of Materials, lists components, their costs, and where to purchase them.
- `Enclosure-and-Assembly` houses information about using physical parts and assembling sensors.
- `Datasheets` has documents with comprehensive info about specific parts.
