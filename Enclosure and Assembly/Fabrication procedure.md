# How to assemble an Open Water Level sensor
## Rough draft
- [ ] Chop 1.5” sch-40 pvc into 8” sections (nb: may want shorter so that cables reach more easily)
- [ ] Drill 9/64” hole 5 cm from top of pvc for solar panel cable
- [ ] 3D print top end cap; sand
- [ ] 3D print bottom end cap; sand
- [ ] Re-tap NPT threads (take care not to use too much force as it can crack the brittle end caps)
- [ ] Cut solar panel cable terminator
- [ ] Pass solar cable into pvc, taking care to give enough slack inside to make connection/solder to microUSB connector and enough outside to be able to maneuver solar panel onto top end cap
- [ ] Solder microUSB connector to solar cable with shrink tubing over bare wire
- [ ] Solder stacking headers onto adalogger featherwing
- [ ] Update system firmware on Boron to match current firmware as shown in Firmware/target directory
- [ ] Insert microSD card into featherwing (microSD card may need to be manually formatted by inserting it into your computer first)
- [ ] Stack Boron on featherwing
- [ ] Attach cellular antenna onto Boron
- [ ] Solder 3-pin cable with female receptacle onto featherwing spare pins corresponding to power, ground, and analog input
- [ ] Solder 3-pin cable with male block onto ultrasonic distance sensor on pins corresponding to power, ground, and analog output
- [ ] Drill holes in top end cap for solar mounting screws (nb: change end cap design so that drilling isn't necessary)
- [ ] If end caps are sanded enough to slide onto PVC all the way, epoxy in place. Allow to fully dry/cure. 
- [ ] Epoxy solar panel cable in place
- [ ] Thread distance sensor into bottom end cap with pipe tape around sensor threads (3 wraps in proper direction)
- [ ] Connect 3-pin cables for distance sensor, through inside of PVC
- [ ] Insert remaining electronics
- [ ] Plug battery into Boron
- [ ] Plug solar panel cable with newly terminated microUSB plug into Boron USB port
- [ ] Plug top end cap with PVC pipe plug
- [ ] Screw solar panel onto top end cap (4-40 screws)
