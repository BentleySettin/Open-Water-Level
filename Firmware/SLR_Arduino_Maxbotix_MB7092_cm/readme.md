# SLR_Arduino_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm
This repo contains a script to operate the MB7092 XL-MaxSonar-WRMA1, with 1 cm resolution, rather than the LV-EZ4 model with 1 in (2.54 cm) resolution which all other repos use.

This sensor is also designed to meet the IP67 rating (high degree of water intrusion protection) unlike the LV-EZ4. 

It has a maximum range of 765 cm (300 inches) and a 10 Hz max read rate (hence sensor sampling is slowed down in comparison with the LV-EZ4 models which have up to 20 Hz sampling rates).
