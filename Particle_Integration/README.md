# Particle Cloud â€”-> Google Sheets Integration
1. Get an access token: https://docs.particle.io/reference/cloud-apis/access-tokens/
2. Create a new Google Sheet
3. In Google Sheets, navigate to Extenstions --> Apps Script
4. Copy and paste the `particle_integration.js` file into the Apps Script
5. Replace `{YOUR_PARTICLE_TOKEN_HERE}` with your token from #1
6. Save/rename Apps Script
7. Deploy --> New Deployment (if first time deploying)
8. Select type --> Web App
9. Execute as --> Me
10. Who has access --> Anyone
11. Deploy --> Authorize access --> Click through and allow
12. Under Web App and URL, there should be a URL beginning https://script...; click Copy
13. In `console.particle.io`, navigate to your product (or device) and create a new integration
14. Create Webhook and select Edit --> Custom template
15. Copy and paste text from `particle_integration.json` and replace `{GOOGLE_SHEETS_SCRIPT_URL}` with the URL that you get after deploying the Apps Script (Step 12); save.
16. Run your Particle firmware that is supposed to publish to the cloud and check if it ran at all (e.g., any LED or Log indicators). Then, check the device in `console.particle.io` to see if it published, check the integration to see if it triggered, and check your Google Sheet to see if the data have shown up.
